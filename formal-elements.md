The closest game is obviously flappy bird where the game objective is similar. The player needs to avoid only one type of obstacle without any further interactions. In our game we introduce different obstacles and interactions, like dynamic pipes which open and close, pipes with a button to open, maybe some power resources, and a boss level.
Our game differs from others in the resources section which other games don't provide.
